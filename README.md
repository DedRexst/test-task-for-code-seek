Hello! If you are reading this text, you are most likely one of those who will be reviewing my test assignment for CodeSeek. I hope everything goes smoothly and well. Although I understand that this is far from a perfect implementation of the test task 
(for example, I couldn't figure out how to avoid sending certain data such as id to the client side, which, as I've heard, is considered a drawback), I hope you will like the work I've done. 
So, goodbye, and thank you for your time!
P.S The JAR file is located here: build/libs/testTaskForCodeSeek-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
